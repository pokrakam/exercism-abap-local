# exercism-abap-local
[Exercism](https://exercism.org) exercises for local development of the [ABAP track](https://exercism.org/tracks/abap) exercises.

## Motivation
Direct download from the Exercism repo via abapGit is not (yet) possible, as there are some technical challenges due to the way abapGit and Exercism structure their content differently. So currently the only option is to copy/paste into a local ABAP system.

## Installation
Pull directly into your ABAP system using abapGit, or clone to your GitHub user if you would like to push your solutions back to your GitHub repo. Note that this is independent of Exercism. 

Either pull the entire package or individual classes using `Selective Pull`

## Completing Exercises
Complete the coding part where indicated. Run the unit tests using `<ctrl>-<shift>-<F10>`. Set breakpoints if needed to see what is happening.

## Submitting Solutions
Once all unit tests pass, copy and paste the class code into the Exercism exercise editor and verify the Exercism unit tests also pass. 
They should pass, but bugs are always lurking. So please raise an issue in the [Exercism ABAP GitHub repo](https://github.com/exercism/abap) if you get any unexpected results for tests that pass on a local SAP system.
