Exercism ABAP track exercises for local development

## Installation
Install using abapGit. Clone to your GitHub user if you would like to push your solutions back to GitHub. Note that this is independent of Exercism. 

Either pull the entire package or individual classes using Selective Pull

## Completing Exercises
Complete the coding part where indicated. Run the unit tests using <ctrl>-<shift>-<F10>. Set breakpoints if needed to see what is happening.

## Submitting Solutions
Once all unit tests pass, copy and paste the class code into the Exercism exercise editor and verify the Exercism unit tests also pass. 
They should pass, but bugs are always lurking. So please submit a question/bug at <?> if you get any unexpected results for tests that pass on a local SAP system.
